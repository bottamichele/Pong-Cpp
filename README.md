# Pong-Cpp

This repository contains my old project which implements the Pong clone game in C++ language.

My project's goals were manly to create a simple game from scratch by using and experimenting OpenGL 
and by practicing the C++ language.

The project's source code can be improved like implementing a good scoreboard, collision system or 
some part of code such as the renderer.
